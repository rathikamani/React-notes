React js: (18-v)
============
Advantage of ReactJS:
==========================
1.Reusable Components
2.Easy Creation of the Dynamic Web Applications
3.Reusable Components
4.Performance Enhancement


Functional Component

->Functional Components is a plain JavaScript, you do not have a choice to set the state in functional component.
->There is no render function we are using in functional components.
->Functional components only accept the props as an argument.
-> Functional components are sometimes called stateless components.

Class Component

-> Class components we have a feature to set the set state in component.
-> In class components, we have a render function which is use to return the react elements.
-> In class components, we have both options use the props and set the state also.
-> Class components are sometimes called stateful components. 


State:
State is a javascript object used to store and manage component-specific data.
you can initialize state in a componet using the "useSate" hook, like this,

import React, { useState } from 'react';
 
function MyComponent() {
  const [myState, setMyState] = useState(initialValue);
 
  // Your component logic here
 
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your JSX using myState */}
    </div>
  );
}

when you call 'setMyState(newValue); React  re-renders your componet with the updated state.

Props:
Props are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child componet.
they are immutable and help in making components more reusable.


In React, components go through a lifecycle of events:

Mounting (adding nodes to the DOM)
Updating (altering existing nodes in the DOM)
Unmounting (removing nodes from the DOM)
Error handling (verifying that your code works and is bug-free)
