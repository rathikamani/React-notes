javascript:
1.array third hightest number (without inbuild method)
function bubbleSort(array) {
  var done = false;
  while (!done) {
    done = true;
    for (var i = 1; i < array.length; i += 1) {
      if (array[i - 1] > array[i]) {
        done = false;
        var tmp = array[i - 1];
        array[i - 1] = array[i];
        array[i] = tmp;
      }
    }
  }

  return array;
}

var numbers = [12, 10, 15, 11, 14, 13, 16];
bubbleSort(numbers);
console.log(numbers);

2.odd or even number 
3.  const arr = ["A","B", "C", "D"];



arr.forEach(

function(index) => {

index + '' + arr(index)

})

);



1. A

2. b

3. C

4. D

arr[2] = "E"

arr.push (arr);



A B E C D


es6:
promise: write

react:
1.hook - problem
only functional component
usecontext - avoid the props drilling
useeffect - avoid rerender page (react virtual dom)
https://daveceddia.com/useeffect-hook-examples/
use 

2.historypush or component router different

3. country (select) and show country flag	




redux:
webapp
rest
restfull
state
store
props

API:
get
put
post
delete
patch


css:
boxmodel

Latest questions:
1.what is state,props?
2.codeing:
country list given then we should in list (dropdown) along with in checkbox?
